# TimeKeeper-App

This is my first attempt at an upp using a GUI using Python's Tkinter module. 

It was a steep learning curve. This project forced me to learn the principals of OOP. Prior to starting this project, I only had a notion of OOP, and not really a feel for why they were used in programming. I quickly realized that I was having difficulties handing off data from one 'section' of my app to the other. Compared to a terminal app that behaved linearly, this was quite troublesome. 

For me, the app is in a semi-complete state. The app is functional, but the styling is horrible in my opinion. I spent some hours trying to tinker with tkinter, but I can't quite make this app aesthetically pleasing. For now, I'll be leaving it as is, and exploring other gui options and perhaps diving in to C#.
